# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

<!-- 1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming? -->

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is different than functional programming because it allows you to think about objects and methods in different ways. You can think of object-oriented programming as classes and less logical programming as functional programming such as JavaScript focuses on functions and methods. 


Researched answer: There are 4 pillars of object-oriented programming, abstraction, ecapsulation, inheartance, and polymorphism. Inhearitance is thought of as the sharing of information, encapsulation is the grouping of information, abstraction is the hiding of information and polymorphism is the redefinding of information. 

<!-- 2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?  -->

Your answer: The answer here is as simple as a (.). A float is a number with a decimal point and a integer is a whole number. Float numbers are used in more accurate programming as where an integer can be used to represent a place. 

Researched answer:A intiger class is the basis for two concrete classes that hold whole numbers. These concrete classes represent Bignum and Fixnum classes. Fload is any number that contains a decimal point. 

<!-- 3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean? -->

Your answer: Implicit returns are always returned when you call methods on an object. This means that you can call methods on an object. 

Researched answer: To start with the arcitecture of a Ruby method, the implicit return is the final statement inside the method. The method will always returrn the result of the final line before the end. 

<!-- 4. What is a block in Ruby? -->

Your answer:Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can pass into methods. In the words of Forest Gump, "That's all I have to say about that." 

Researched answer: A Ruby block is a block that can be passed into methods. The Blocks themselves are little anonymous functions that arre enclosed in a do/end statement or with the use of brackets. A Ruby block can be a bit of logic that you want to use for later like printing a error message. 

<!-- 5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash? -->

Your answer: Using square brackets of course! A hash is a collection of key value pairs where the key is a symbol and value is any data type and to access the value we use square brackets. 

Researched answer:A hash uses a set of curly braces which contains key-value paisr separated by commas. Each value uses a hash rocket ( => ) and calling the hash followed by a key name within a set of brackets grabs the value of that key. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance is supported only in single class inheritance while not supporting multiple class inheritance. Ruby does support mixins. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Ruby and object oriented programming because it allows the programmer to access charachteristcs of a class into another. 

2. RSpec: Unlike test driven development Ruby RSpec focuses on behavior-based testing. RSpec is simply a testing tool that allows this behavior based testing. It features a powerful DSL but at the core is a simple tool that you can use quickly. 

3. CRUD: CRUS is a operation used for web development. It stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete These aerr the four major operrations that we use to work a set of data in a database. 

4. Test-driven development: Test driven development focuses on a method of implimenting software that intelaces unit testing, progamming and refactoring on the programming language. 

5. HTTP: Hypetext transfer protocal is a set of rules for transferring files all over the web. These files include text, images, sound, video and othe mulimedia and is bound to the rules of HTTP. When we interact with the web and open a browser we are indirectly using http. Http is the less secure protocal of the two while HTTP uses TLS (SSL) to encrype normal HTTP requests and responses. HTTPS is fa more secure because each request and response is digitally signed.
